# **Bank-API-Automation-Testing-Framework-POJO-Exercise**


This repository contains the development of a Java project using RestAssured to automate the testing of a bank API. The testing scenarios implemented include:

- Test 1: Verify that the endpoint is empty.
- Test 2: Initialize the POJO with 10 random user data and perform the POST request to create the user.
- Test 3: Make the GET request to get the users, asserting that there are no duplicate email accounts.
- Test 4: Add a test to update an existing AccountNumber.
- Test 5: Add a test to verify the correct deposit of money.
